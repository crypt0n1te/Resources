# Resources

Just a general repository for resources we find. I have made this public so feel free to share around and update regularly.

**Contributions are now very welcome, if you have any - please submit them here:**
```crypt0nite1@protonmail.com```

We accept pretty much any suggestions ~~although free udemy courses might be crossing the line~~
